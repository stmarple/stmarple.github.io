			<p>
				Some people might consider me a stubborn person.  Like many young kids, with young parents, and no money to speak of, not even to buy 
				a decent set of clothes in most my child life, I spent more time dodging bullies than working on my homework.  Needless to say, my 
				grades really weren't much to be proud of.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Going into middle school, I could barely read and had a dreadful stutter when attempting to read aloud amidst my classmates.  The 
				bullies following me just about whereever I went, just to laugh at my demise.  For these reasons, I was placed in all "average"
				 classes, which really just prepares students for life of a person with his name on his shirt for the rest of his adult life.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, even at the young age of about 11, I found a passion of my life starting to grow within me:  Math.  Math just made sense.  
				It was logical like chess or checkers, two of my favorite games.  I was our class' legend at checkers in first grade.  I rarely lost, 
				and when I did, it was a close match.  And chess; well that is just something I could spend hours and hours playing.  After a while 
				though, chess against a computer got to the point where it would be predictable and lost its fun.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Since being placed in all average classes, in addition to a special reading class in middle school, boy did the bullies roll in.  I 
				was the dumb kid in the front of the class looking to turn my life around so that I could get in a good school.  I was also 
				determined to take Calculus in my senior year of high school.  In order to do that however, I needed to push myself and had some 
				catching up in order to make that happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				What the teachers didn't realize was that I wasn't just a lazy student, refusing to learn anything.  I was just someone who was 
				afraid of being bullied and had a stutter because I was shy.  It wasn't that I couldn't read.  I read all the time.  I was just 
				afraid of reading out loud.  
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time I reached high school, I was finally out of extra reading classes and working towards getting my language requirements 
				out of the way.  In 9th grade, it was Algebra 1.  I was a full year behind the track I was determined to be on.  After getting 
				straight A's in Algebra 1, and all A's and B's for all of my other classes for the first time in my scholactic studies, I was able to 
				speak with my math teacher and get a recommendation to take both Geometry and Honors Algebra 2 in 10th grade, despite my guidance 
				counselor's strong position of holding me back from attaining my dream. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And by my senior year of high school, I not only got to take Honors Calculus, but I also had the opportunity to get a 100 average in 
				2 of the 4 quarters.  I even got to take a few other honors classes like Chemistry and Physics.  It was also in my senior year that I 
				decided that something needed to change in me.  I needed to conquer my fears.  Yet again, in spite of my guidance counselor in school 
				(a different one, at a different high school), I decided to join the army.  Another person telling me that I cannot do something... 
				What is it with people??  It was that day that I decided that no one was going to tell me what I cannot do anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
				After boot camp, I started community college, since I got back in January, and I also took a job in a company, called Quickstar, or 
				the modern day Amway.  I learned a ton while working with some of the most successful people I have ever met!  I started learning how 
				to beat my shyness.  Every day, I decided to follow their lead and to say hello to at least one person.  Then it was 3 people.  Next, 
				I was talking about the weather, then about their likes and dislikes about their classes.  Before long, I new a ton of people at 
				school.  More people would say "Hi, Shaun", in the halls than I even remembered that I talked with once or twice.  In my Sophomore 
				year, I was elected vice president of my school's international honor society because so many people knew and liked me.
			</p>
			<p>
				After 2 years in the community college, I set out to start school at UCONN.  However, after just one year, realizing that I still 
				didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I dropped out to find my passion.  I worked many many roles over the years.  I worked 
				in hospitality, construction, machining, factories, ...etc.  I took roles that freaked me out in order to conquer some of the fears I 
				still had, since I still really hadn't found my calling.  I worked as a waiter and a bartender to face my fears in talking to 
				people.  I worked in construction doing just about everything involved including plumbing, building houses, chimney pointing, driving 
				a dump truck, operating a back hoe, installing heated floors, and major renovation projects including the former castle at Cornfield Point, which was made into a private home by my former boss.  One thing to know about working for a well-known developer and mason, is that perfection is the only thing that is acceptable.  If the stone windows aren't cut to fit a new window that is perfectly level, you better grab a jackhammer and my make it level. If the foundation of the house isn't level, you better do what needs to be done to make the window 'look' level.

			<p>
				7 Years of searching and I decided that I had to work with my brain.  Over my career, I have witnessed many things that can go wrong with "working with your hands". In 2012, I went back to school as an Actuarial Science major.  When my professor heard that not only had I been out of school for a few years, with exception with a couple of part-time classes here and there, but also that I had transferred into the program with a community college degree, he looked me in the eyes, smiled and told me that I was likely not going to survive the class, let alone the program.   
			</p>
			<p>
				For anyone else, the might have been a hard pill to swallow.  For me it was yet another challenge.  And, as I witnessed in the program, he was likely speaking the truth for most people of my background.  With somewhere around 200 students in the program, only a few graduate each year due to the extreme difficulty of the coursework. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two years later, not only did I get a B in the class that my professor said that I would fail, but I also went on to do well in 5 more actuarial courses.  I finished with my Statistics' degree in order to graduate sooner, but was only 1 class short of my actuarial science bachelors degree.
